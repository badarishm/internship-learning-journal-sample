FastAPI Project Workflow;
This session explained the complete TDS project workflow and how to build, test, and deploy a FastAPI server.

Key Learnings:

1.Project Workflow:
- Understood the step-by-step process of building, testing, and deploying a project.
- Importance of structured development and proper testing.

2.FastAPI Basics:
- Set up a FastAPI project.
- Created the first "GET request".
- Learned about "path parameters" and "query parameters".

3.Data Validation:
- Used "Pydantic models" for request and response validation.
- Implemented "POST requests" with proper data validation.

4.File Uploads;
- Handled single and multiple file uploads using FastAPI.

 5.Testing:
- Tested APIs using "curl" commands.
- Used GitHub Copilot to help generate test cases.
- Created a Bash script for live API testing.

6.Deployment & Security:
- Managed secret keys using environment variables.
- Created a "Dockerfile" for containerization.
- Deployed the FastAPI app to "Hugging Face Spaces".

What I Took Away:

- FastAPI makes API development simple and structured.
- Validation and testing are essential before deployment.
- Docker helps package applications for deployment.
- Proper workflow improves project reliability and scalability.
