Deployment & APIs – 
This session covered container basics, deploying websites, building APIs with FastAPI, and deploying applications using Vercel and ngrok.

Key Learnings:
1.Containers:
- Understood difference between **containers and virtual machines**.
- Compared **Podman vs Docker**.
- Containers are lightweight and efficient for development.

2.GitHub Pages:
- Learned how to deploy a static website using **GitHub Pages**.
- Hosted a simple site directly from a GitHub repository.

3.FastAPI:
- Introduction to **FastAPI** for building APIs.
- Learned about HTTP methods:
  - `GET` → Retrieve data
  - `POST` → Send data
- Tested endpoints using FastAPI's built-in documentation.

4.Vercel Deployment:
- Deployed a FastAPI project to **Vercel**.
- Understood limitations like timeouts.
- Used Vercel CLI for deployment.

5:ngrok & Local Development:
- Used "ngrok" to expose local servers to the internet.
- Helpful for testing webhooks and APIs.

6.Environment Variables & Security:
- Managed secrets using environment variables.
- Learned basics of **CORS** and why it is important for APIs.

What I Took Away:
- Containers help package applications efficiently.
- GitHub Pages is useful for hosting static websites.
- FastAPI is powerful and simple for building APIs.
- Vercel enables easy cloud deployment.
- ngrok helps test local applications online.
- Environment variables are important for security.
