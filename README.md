## 🚀 Key Learnings So Far
# Week 1 – Learnings

Week 1 focused on building the foundational setup and understanding the essential tools required for development in the TDS course.



1. Set up WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and installed Ubuntu to create a Linux-based development environment on Windows.
2. Learned the importance of Linux in real-world development and why many tools work better in a Unix-like environment.
3. Understood how to use the terminal and execute basic Linux commands.
4. Navigated the Linux file system using commands like cd, ls, pwd, mkdir, etc.
5. Learned the difference between absolute paths and relative paths.
6. Understood key Linux directories and how files are structured.
7. Installed Git and understood its role in version control.
8. Created a GitHub account and linked it with the local system.
9. Generated SSH keys for secure authentication with GitHub.
10. Learned how SSH improves security compared to HTTPS.
11. Created repositories on GitHub.
12. Cloned repositories locally using SSH.
13. Made local changes and pushed them back to GitHub.
14. Learned commit workflow:
    - git add
    - git commit
    - git push
15. Understood the importance of version tracking and collaboration.
16. Integrated VS Code with WSL for seamless development.
17. Used the VS Code terminal to run Linux commands.
18. Learned the importance of APIs in modern applications.
19. Understood how tools and workflows are as important as coding.
20. Built a strong foundation for working in a collaborative development environment.



# Week 2 – Learnings

In Week 2, I moved from basic setup into hands-on development, deployment, and AI tool integration.



1. Learned how containerization works using Podman and understood how containers isolate applications along with their dependencies.

2. Deployed development tools like Jupyter Lab and local LLMs inside containers and learned how to manage container lifecycle.

3. Understood port binding and volume mounting to make container services accessible and persist data.

4. Explored container networking to allow communication between multiple services such as backend apps and AI models.

5. Built a FastAPI application and learned how APIs are structured using routes, requests, and responses.

6. Practiced handling GET and POST requests in FastAPI and understood how backend services interact with frontend or external tools.

7. Learned how to deploy applications using platforms like Hugging Face Spaces and GitHub Pages.

8. Understood real-world deployment challenges such as environment configuration and runtime limitations.

9. Used GitHub Codespaces for cloud-based development without relying on local machine setup.

10. Learned how GitHub Actions can automate workflows like testing and deployment.

11. Integrated LLM tools into development workflows and understood how APIs connect AI models to applications.

12. Practiced managing API keys securely using environment variables.

13. Understood how development workflows improve when tools like containers, APIs, and automation are combined.

14. Learned how real-world applications connect backend logic with AI capabilities.

15. Improved repository structure by organizing chapters, notes, and hands-on learnings for better documentation.


#  Week 3 – Learnings

In Week 3, I focused on understanding how modern AI systems work using embeddings, vector databases, RAG, APIs, and function calling, along with practical implementation.



1. Learned how Large Language Models (LLMs) work using tokens, transformers, and self-attention mechanisms.

2. Understood how APIs connect applications to AI models and practiced making API calls using httpx and curl.

3. Learned how to securely manage API keys using environment variables and `.bashrc`.

4. Built chatbot systems using structured conversation roles:
   - system
   - user
   - assistant

5. Learned how embeddings convert text and images into vectors for semantic understanding.

6. Used similarity techniques such as cosine similarity and vector distance to retrieve meaningful results.

7. Understood how vector databases store embeddings for fast similarity search.

8. Learned Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve response accuracy by retrieving relevant data.

9. Implemented Hybrid RAG by combining similarity-based retrieval with structured search.

10. Practiced chunking large documents into smaller sections to stay within token limits.

11. Learned how multimodal models process both text and images using Base64 encoding.

12. Extracted structured data using function calling and defined schemas for automation.

13. Built similarity-based question answering systems using embeddings.

14. Used NumPy for vector operations and async API calls for better performance.

15. Understood the importance of prompt engineering for improving LLM responses.

16. Learned about evaluation techniques to ensure reliability and cost efficiency.

17. Debugged API issues and deployment problems related to FastAPI and environment configuration.

18. Understood how agents and tools help automate complex workflows.

19. Applied these concepts in Project 1 using embeddings and retrieval logic.

20. Learned how secure API handling and structured workflows are essential for real-world AI applications.
