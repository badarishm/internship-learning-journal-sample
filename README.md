## 🚀 Key Learnings So Far
# Week 1 – Learnings

Week 1 focused on building the foundational setup and understanding the essential tools required for development in the TDS course.



1. Set up WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and installed Ubuntu to create a Linux-based development environment on Windows.
2. Learned the importance of Linux in real-world development and why many tools work better in a Unix-like environment.
3. Understood how to use the terminal and execute basic Linux commands.
4. Navigated the Linux file system using commands like cd, ls, pwd, mkdir, etc.
5. Learned the difference between absolute paths and relative paths.
6. Understood key Linux directories and how files are structured.
7. Installed Git and understood its role in version control.
8. Created a GitHub account and linked it with the local system.
9. Generated SSH keys for secure authentication with GitHub.
10. Learned how SSH improves security compared to HTTPS.
11. Created repositories on GitHub.
12. Cloned repositories locally using SSH.
13. Made local changes and pushed them back to GitHub.
14. Learned commit workflow:
    - git add
    - git commit
    - git push
15. Understood the importance of version tracking and collaboration.
16. Integrated VS Code with WSL for seamless development.
17. Used the VS Code terminal to run Linux commands.
18. Learned the importance of APIs in modern applications.
19. Understood how tools and workflows are as important as coding.
20. Built a strong foundation for working in a collaborative development environment.



# Week 2 – Learnings

In Week 2, I moved from basic setup into hands-on development, deployment, and AI tool integration.



1. Learned how containerization works using Podman and understood how containers isolate applications along with their dependencies.

2. Deployed development tools like Jupyter Lab and local LLMs inside containers and learned how to manage container lifecycle.

3. Understood port binding and volume mounting to make container services accessible and persist data.

4. Explored container networking to allow communication between multiple services such as backend apps and AI models.

5. Built a FastAPI application and learned how APIs are structured using routes, requests, and responses.

6. Practiced handling GET and POST requests in FastAPI and understood how backend services interact with frontend or external tools.

7. Learned how to deploy applications using platforms like Hugging Face Spaces and GitHub Pages.

8. Understood real-world deployment challenges such as environment configuration and runtime limitations.

9. Used GitHub Codespaces for cloud-based development without relying on local machine setup.

10. Learned how GitHub Actions can automate workflows like testing and deployment.

11. Integrated LLM tools into development workflows and understood how APIs connect AI models to applications.

12. Practiced managing API keys securely using environment variables.

13. Understood how development workflows improve when tools like containers, APIs, and automation are combined.

14. Learned how real-world applications connect backend logic with AI capabilities.

15. Improved repository structure by organizing chapters, notes, and hands-on learnings for better documentation.
