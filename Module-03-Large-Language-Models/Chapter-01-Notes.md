Module 3 – LLMs, RAG & Advanced Concepts:
This session covered important conceptual topics related to LLMs, APIs, embeddings, vector databases, RAG, multimodal models, agents, and evaluation techniques.

Key Learnings;

1.APIs & LLM Basics:
- Learned how API keys and proxies are used to access AI models securely.
- Understood how **LLMs (Large Language Models)** work.
- Learned about **tokens**, **transformers**, and **self-attention**.
- Discussed context length limitations in LLMs.

2.Embeddings & Vector Concepts:
- Learned what **embeddings** are and how text is converted into vectors.
- Introduction to **topic modeling**.
- Understood **vector databases** like ChromaDB and LanceDB.
- Learned how similarity search works.

3.Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):
- Basic idea of **RAG** (retrieving data before generating answers).
- Concept of **Hybrid RAG** combining multiple search methods.
- Importance of retrieval for improving accuracy.

4.Multimodal & Media Processing:
- Learned about **Base64 encoding**.
- Introduction to **vision models**, image and audio processing.
- Basic idea of video frame analysis.

5.Prompt Engineering & Applications:
- Techniques for better prompt design.
- Sentiment analysis and text extraction.
- Use of schemas for structured outputs.
- Function calling with LLMs (example: travel agent).
- Interaction with SQL databases using LLMs.

6.Agents & Tools:
- Concept of tools and agents using LLMs.
- Automating tasks with structured workflows.

7:Evaluation & Testing
- Importance of LLM evaluation.
- Testing with YAML files and assertions.
- Cost effectiveness and regression testing.
- Commercial applications of LLM systems.

What I Took Away:

- LLMs use transformers and self-attention to process tokens.
- Embeddings convert text into vectors for similarity search.
- RAG improves model responses using external data.
- Multimodal models handle text, images, audio, and video.
- Prompt engineering, evaluation, and cost control are critical for real-world applications.
