TDS Introductory Session – Reflection
The introductory session of Tools in Data Science helped me understand the course structure, expectations, and the skills required to succeed.
I learned the difference between the Course Portal (materials and submissions) and the Seek Portal (official grading). Proper submission process and meeting deadlines are very important.
The course expects basic programming knowledge, especially in Python. It focuses not only on theory but also on practical tools like Git, GitHub, Linux, and command-line usage.
A major takeaway was the importance of APIs and deployment skills. Real-world Data Science is not just about analysis — it is about building, integrating, and deploying working solutions.
Projects will be done in teams, which means collaboration, communication, and proper version control are essential.
The session also introduced WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), highlighting the importance of setting up a proper Linux-based development environment.
