WSL, Linux Navigation & LLM Tools:
This session teaches how to use "WSL and basic Linux commands", and how to set up and use "UV & LLM tools" to interact with "Gemini" and "GPT" models from the terminal.

Key Learnings:
WSL & System Basics
- WSL lets you run Linux inside Windows.
- Learned what hypervisors are and their role in virtualization.

Linux File System:
- Navigated Ubuntu’s file system inside WSL.
- Learned difference between "absolute" and "relative paths".
- Compared Linux and Windows directory structures.
- Explored key directories and how to move between them.

Command-Line Importance;
- Q&A on why learning command-line tools matters for development.

VS Code Integration;
- Integrated **VS Code terminal** with WSL for smooth workflow.

Installing Tools;
- Installed the "UV" tool.
- Installed the "LLM" tool via UV.

API Keys Setup:
- Configured "Gemini API Key".
- Configured "OpenAI & AI-Pipe API Keys".

Using LLM from Terminal:
- Learned how to use the `llm` command to interact with GPT and Gemini models.

What I Took Away:
- WSL and terminal navigation are key skills for development.
- UV and LLM tools let you use AI models directly in the terminal.
- Knowing how to set API keys is essential to connect tools with real AI services.
