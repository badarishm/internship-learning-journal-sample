macOS & Linux Development Environment Setup:
This session shows how to set up a development environment on **macOS and Linux**, including **VS Code**, **Homebrew**, **Git**, **pyenv**, **UV**, and **LLM CLI tools**.

Key Learnings:

VS Code & GitHub Tools:
- Installed "VS Code" editor.
- Set up "GitHub Education Pack" and "Copilot".

Homebrew Package Manager:
- Installed "Homebrew" on macOS.
- Added Homebrew to system "PATH".
- Used Homebrew to install other tools.

Python Version Management:
- Installed "pyenv" for managing multiple Python versions.
- Set project-specific Python versions using pyenv.

UV Project Tool:
- Installed and used "UV" for project management and tool installation.

GitHub CLI:
- Installed "GitHub CLI" (`gh`).
- Created a GitHub repository directly from the terminal.

LLM Command-Line Tool:
- Installed the "LLM CLI" tool.
- Configured "Gemini" API key for LLM.
- Ran a demo to "transcribe audio" using the LLM CLI tool.

What I Took Away:
- VS Code, Homebrew, GitHub CLI, and pyenv form the foundation of a developer setup.
- UV helps manage tools and project environments.
- LLM CLI can be configured to use AI models like Gemini for tasks like transcription.
